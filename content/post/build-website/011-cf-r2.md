## R2 vs S3

[Cloudflare R2 vs AWS S3 | Review Pricing & Features | Cloudflare](https://www.cloudflare.com/en-ca/pg-cloudflare-r2-vs-aws-s3/)

## Install mc and configure

```shell
# just install minio client not minio server
brew install minio/stable/mc

mc alias set r2 R2-URL AccessKey SecretKey
```

> The MinIO client provides identical commands to Unix file management commands, such as cp and ls, but is designed for both local and remote storage systems. Itâ€™s fully compatible with AWS S3.

## Common Commands

```shell
mc ls <ALIAS>/<BucketName>: List all objects in a bucket.

mc cp -r <LOCAL-FOLDER-PATH> <ALIAS>/<BUCKET>/<REMOTE-FOLDER-PATH>: Upload a folder to a bucket.

mc rm <ALIAS>/<BUCKET>/<OBJECT>: Remove an object.
```
