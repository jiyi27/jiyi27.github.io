## 1. Redis data types

### 1.1. String

Redis Strings is one of the most versatile of Redis’ building blocks, a **binary-safe** data structure, binary-safe means the strings in Redis can be any binary data. In Redis, strings are multipurpose. They can store data as simple as an integer or as complex as a JPEG image file.

**Strings is an array data structure of bytes** (or words) that stores a sequence of elements, typically characters, using some character encoding. It can store any data-a string, integer, floating point value, JPEG image, serialized Ruby object, or anything else you want it to carry. 

```shell
redis> set mykey "This is a string"
OK
redis> get mykey
"This is a string"
```

### 1.2. Hash

A Redis hash is a data type that represents a **mapping between** **a string field and a string value**. There is no integer or float value in hash, just string. 

```shell
> hset bike:1 model Deimos type 'Enduro bikes' price 4972
(integer) 3
> hget bike:1 model
"Deimos"
> hget bike:1 price
"4972"
> hgetall bike:1
1) "model"
2) "Deimos"
3) "type"
4) "Enduro bikes"
5) "price"
6) "4972"
```

Note that the output of `> hget bike:1 price` is `"4972"` not `4972`, which is a string. 

On the surface, think of a hash data type as an enclosed set of key/value pairs inside the value of another key. The embedded keys are called **fields**. So a string is stored inside a **key** and inside a particular **field** within that key. 

Figure 3 shows the basics of how a hash is stored. The key is associated with a hash object. That hash object can have multiple fields (i.e., subkeys) associated with individual strings. This allows you to store more complex data types.

## 2. Key-value database

All data in Redis are stored as key-value pairs, **Redis keys** are always strings, **Redis values** can be strings, hashes, lists, sets or sorted sets. 

> A good practice for naming keys is to create and stick to a particular schema. For example, a common scheme for identifying objects is to use an `object-type:id` schema. So an object representing user id#1000 would be attached to the key name `user:1000`. An object representing a purchase order with an order number of 1234 might be attached to a key named `order:1234`.
>
> Additionally, keys related to the base object can use suffixes on the key. For example, while the user id#1000 can use the key `user:1000`, a queue associated with that user could use the key `user:1000:queue`.

### 2.1. Key is always string

When you store a hash object in Redis, the key is still a string, and the value is a hash data structure:

```shell
127.0.0.1:6379> hset user:1 name Alice age 6
(integer) 2
127.0.0.1:6379> set os Ubuntu
OK
127.0.0.1:6379> keys *
1) "user:1"
2) "os"
```

As you can see there we created two key-value data above, the first one's value is a hash and second one's value is a string, that's the only difference. You may think the first key `"user:1"` a littler strange, but it's just a string, you can name it as `user-1`, `user1` or other form,  `"user:1"` is just a hash's key naming convention in Redis. 

And we use key to retrieve data:

```shell
127.0.0.1:6379> get os
"Ubuntu"
127.0.0.1:6379> hget user:1 age
"6"
127.0.0.1:6379> hgetall user:1 
1) "name"
2) "Alice"
3) "age"
4) "6"
```

Retrieving hash value in Redis is a little complited, as you can see, we use string `"user:1"` to retrieve the hash value `{"name":"Alice", "age", "6"}`, then we use the string `"age"` to get the string value `"6"`. 

### 2.2. Don't forget all is string

Note that we are in the Redis command line, therefore we don't need make the key or value string explicitly, what I mean is that the both codes belwo is fine:

```shell
127.0.0.1:6379> set "greeting" "helloworld"
OK
127.0.0.1:6379> set greeting helloworld
OK
127.0.0.1:6379> hset user:1 name Alice age 12
127.0.0.1:6379> hset "user:1" "name" "Alice" "age" "12"
```

Bu you should know that they are string!

> In Redis, a key-value pair is a fundamental data structure used for storing and retrieving data. The "key" is a unique identifier that is used to access the associated "value".
>
> A Redis hash is a data type that represents a mapping between a string field and a string value. 

## 3. Redis features

- **Atomic Operations**: Redis operations are atomic, ensuring data integrity and consistency, even in concurrent environments, a feature particularly complementary to Go’s concurrent capabilities.

- **Persistence**: Even though Redis is an in-memory store, it offers optional durability. This means you can periodically save the data in memory to disk without compromising performance.
  - Redis provides different methods to persist data on disk without sacrificing much performance. Configuring the right persistence option can make a significant impact.
  - **RDB Snapshots**: RDB persistence offers point-in-time snapshots of your dataset at specified intervals.
  - **Append-Only File (AOF)**: Logs every write operation received by the server, allowing complete data recovery.

- Versatility: Redis isn’t just a simple key-value store. It supports various data structures like strings, hashes, lists, sets, and more, making it adaptable to diverse caching needs.

- Scalability: With features like replication, partitioning, and clustering, Redis is designed for high availability and horizontal scaling, catering to applications of all sizes.
  - **Horizontal Scaling**: Using Redis Cluster, you can distribute data across multiple machines.
  - **Vertical Scaling**: Increasing the hardware resources (CPU, Memory) of your existing Redis server.
  - **Replication**: Setting up master-slave replication to distribute read queries among multiple nodes.

- Time-to-Live (TTL): Redis supports the assignment of expiration times to keys, making it conducive to caching scenarios.

## 4. Use cases

### 4.1. Session Store

There are many ways to save sessions, in-memory, file, database and Redis, if you don't know session, please refer to: [Cookie & Session](https://davidzhu.xyz/post/cs-basics/005-session-cookie/)

### 4.2. Caching
