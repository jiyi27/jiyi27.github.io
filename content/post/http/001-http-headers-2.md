### 1. Strict-Transport-Security

Q: Disable HTTP access to the domain, donâ€™t even redirect or link it to SSL. Just inform the users this website is not accessible over HTTP and they have to access it over SSL. 

A: I can't see any technical reason why HTTP needs to be completely blocked either, and **many sites do forward HTTP to HTTPS. When doing this** it is highly advisable to implement HTTP Strict Transport Security (HSTS) which is a web security mechanism which declares that browsers are to only use HTTPS connections.

HSTS is implemented by specifying a **response header** such as `Strict-Transport-Security: max-age=31536000`. Complying user agents will automatically turn insecure links into secure links, thereby reducing the risk of man-in-the-middle attacks.
