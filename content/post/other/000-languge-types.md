## 1. Compiled vs interpreted language

Programming languages are for humans to read and understand. The program (source code) must be translated into machine language so that the computer can execute the program. **The time when this translation occurs** depends on whether the programming language is a **compiled language** or an **interpreted language**. Instead of translating the source code into machine language before the executable file is created, an interpreter converts the source code into machine language at the same time the program runs.
