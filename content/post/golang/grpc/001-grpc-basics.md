## 1. Differences between gRPC and REST

Whilst REST and gRPC are somewhat similar, there are some fundamental differences in how they work that you should be aware of.

1. gRPC utilizes `HTTP/2` whereas REST utilizes `HTTP 1.1`
2. gRPC utilizes the protocol buffer data format as opposed to the standard JSON data format that is typically used within REST APIs
3. With gRPC you can utilize `HTTP/2` capabilities such as server-side streaming, client-side streaming or even bidirectional-streaming should you wish.
