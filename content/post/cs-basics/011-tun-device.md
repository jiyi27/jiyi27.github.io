## 1. TUN (network TUNnel) Device

In computer networking, **TUN** and **TAP** are two different kernel **virtual network devices**. Though both are for tunneling purposes, TUN and TAP can't be used together because they transmit and receive packets at different layers of the network stack. TUN (network TUNnel) devices are used for IP packet-level tunneling, while TAP (network TAP) devices are used for Ethernet frame-level tunneling.

> By default, tun devices operate in the layer 3 mode, and it's point to point.

## 2. `utun*` interface

### 2.1. `utun*` is a peer to peer network interface for TUN device

On macOS, the `utun` interface is a type of TUN device specifically designed for VPN connections to handle the network traffic **within the VPN tunnel** [regardless of whether VPN is enabled](https://apple.stackexchange.com/questions/310220/who-creates-utun0-adapter). 

I'll give you an example to demonstrate the realtionship between TUN device and utun interface, the code below written in Go is to create a TUN device:

```go
// New() creates a new TUN/TAP interface using config.
ifce, err := water.New(water.Config{DeviceType: water.TUN})
```

Before run this code there are 4 utun interfaces on my mac:

```shell
$ ifconfig
utun0: flags=8051<UP,POINTOPOINT,RUNNING,MULTICAST> mtu 1380
	inet6 fe80::652e:88dd:ddb0:ad93%utun0 prefixlen 64 scopeid 0xf 
	nd6 options=201<PERFORMNUD,DAD>
...
utun4: flags=8051<UP,POINTOPOINT,RUNNING,MULTICAST> mtu 1380
	inet6 fe80::e305:5ba8:574a:a5ac%utun4 prefixlen 64 scopeid 0x13 
	nd6 options=201<PERFORMNUD,DAD>
```

After I run the Go codes above with `sudo`, there are 5 utun interfaces but with no ip information:

```shell
$ ifconfig
...
utun4: flags=8051<UP,POINTOPOINT,RUNNING,MULTICAST> mtu 1380
	inet6 fe80::e305:5ba8:574a:a5ac%utun4 prefixlen 64 scopeid 0x13 
	nd6 options=201<PERFORMNUD,DAD>
utun5: flags=8051<UP,POINTOPOINT,RUNNING,MULTICAST> mtu 1500
```

> `utun*` is a **point-to-point** interface, also called a tunnel or a peer-to-peer interface, It doesn't behave like "shared medium" interfaces such as Wi-Fi or Ethernet, which connect you to multiple devices. Instead, it behaves like a cable that just has hosts on both ends.

### 2.2. `utun*` is just a network interface

`utun*` is just a network interface similar to `en0`, `lo0`, when you input `ifconfig` command, they will listed together:

```shell
$ ifconfig     
lo0: flags=8049<UP,LOOPBACK,RUNNING,MULTICAST> mtu 16384
	options=1203<RXCSUM,TXCSUM,TXSTATUS,SW_TIMESTAMP>
	inet 127.0.0.1 netmask 0xff000000 
	inet6 ::1 prefixlen 128 
	inet6 fe80::1%lo0 prefixlen 64 scopeid 0x1 
	nd6 options=201<PERFORMNUD,DAD>
en0: flags=8863<UP,BROADCAST,SMART,RUNNING,SIMPLEX,MULTICAST> mtu 1500
	options=6463<RXCSUM,TXCSUM,TSO4,TSO6,CHANNEL_IO,PARTIAL_CSUM,ZEROINVERT_CSUM>
	ether d4:57:63:da:b6:98 
	inet6 fe80::475:ca98:8ecc:d86%en0 prefixlen 64 secured scopeid 0xc 
	inet 192.168.2.15 netmask 0xffffff00 broadcast 192.168.2.255
	inet6 fdd0:ed77:f347:4d69:859:d993:f358:5af9 prefixlen 64 autoconf secured 
	nd6 options=201<PERFORMNUD,DAD>
	media: autoselect
	status: active
en1: flags=8963<UP,BROADCAST,SMART,RUNNING,PROMISC,SIMPLEX,MULTICAST> mtu 1500
	options=460<TSO4,TSO6,CHANNEL_IO>
	ether 36:6b:75:95:04:c0 
	media: autoselect <full-duplex>
	status: inactive
utun0: flags=8051<UP,POINTOPOINT,RUNNING,MULTICAST> mtu 1380
	inet6 fe80::652e:88dd:ddb0:ad93%utun0 prefixlen 64 scopeid 0xf 
	nd6 options=201<PERFORMNUD,DAD>
utun1: flags=8051<UP,POINTOPOINT,RUNNING,MULTICAST> mtu 2000
	inet6 fe80::a13f:9a63:f8cb:4017%utun1 prefixlen 64 scopeid 0x10 
	nd6 options=201<PERFORMNUD,DAD>
...
```

Find more about what these interface are: https://stackoverflow.com/a/55232331/16317008

e.g.,

```shell
utun3: flags=8051<UP,POINTOPOINT,RUNNING,MULTICAST> mtu 1500
        inet 10.8.0.18 --> 10.8.0.17 netmask 0xffffffff
```

With "normal" interfaces, configuring an address with subnet mask like `192.168.1.3/24` on eth0 is really just shorthand for saying "My address is `192.168.1.3` and I also have an on-link route `192.168.1.0/24 dev eth0`". The on-link route is derived from combining the address & subnet mask.

With point-to-point interfaces, it's actually the same idea. This example means "My address is `10.8.0.18` and I also have an on-link route `10.8.0.17/32 dev utun3`." In this case the autogenerated route is a /32, indicating only one host â€“ the "peer".

*(Note: My examples use Linux iproute2-style syntax.)* So in the end, the difference between `10.8.0.17 netmask 0xffffffff` and `10.8.0.17/32` styles is just that automatic route.

### Assign ip address for an `utun` interface

```shell
$ tldr ifconfig
- View network settings of an Ethernet adapter:
    ifconfig eth0

- Display details of all interfaces, including disabled interfaces:
    ifconfig -a

- Disable eth0 interface:
    ifconfig eth0 down

- Enable eth0 interface:
    ifconfig eth0 up

- Assign IP address to eth0 interface:
    ifconfig eth0 ip_address
```

For example, if you have two machines, one we label "local" with a LAN IP address like 192.168.0.12 and another we label "remote" with a LAN IP address like 192.168.1.14, you can assign tunnel IP addresses thusly:

```shell
ifconfig tun0 inet 10.0.0.1 10.0.0.2 up
```

on the local system, and:

```shell
ifconfig tun0 inet 10.0.0.2 10.0.0.1 up
```

on the remote system. Note the reversed perspective on the remote machine. Do not set your point to point addresses to anything on an existing subnet; it will not route properly.

> Note, if you set a wrong interface, you can cancle it with  `sudo ifconfig utun2 delete 10.1.0.10 10.1.0.20 ` or `ifconfig en1 delete 192.168.141.99` for differnt types of network interfaces.
