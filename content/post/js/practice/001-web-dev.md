## 1. Delay function

```js
function delay(minutes) {
    return new Promise(resolve => setTimeout(resolve, minutes * 1000 * 60));
}

// await delay(2)
```

## 2. Click copy

```html
<p id="url-text" style="display: none">{{.SharedUrl}}</p>
<button onclick="copyText()">share</button>

<script>
    function copyText() {
        const copyText = document.getElementById("url-text");
        navigator.clipboard.writeText(copyText.textContent)
            .then(() => {
                alert("successfully copied");
            })
            .catch(() => {
                alert("something went wrong");
            });
    }
</script>
```

## 3. Relative path

You can write relative path directly for the endpoint, because the browser know the **Origin**, when you make HTTP request, it knows where should go.

```html
<form method="post" action="/login">
  ...
</form>
```

And it's ok to write relative path when redirect in Go code:

```html
// Redirect to login page.
http.Redirect(w, r, "/login", http.StatusFound)
```

## 4. Send username and password form

> If you have a login page with user name and password, do not tell users that they entered a wrong password. Tell them that they entered wrong credentials. You donâ€™t want to give hackers a way to know if a user name is right or wrong. [source](https://www.reddit.com/r/PHPhelp/comments/14pwb53/comment/jqk830i/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web2x&context=3) 

Traditional way to submit a form:

```html
<form action="/login">
  <input type="text" name="name">
  <input type="password" name="psaaword">
  <input type="submit" value="Submit">
</form> 
```

The form data will be sent to `/login` endpoint of the server automatically. After check the input, you may make ajax with `fetch()` to send form data:

```js
let data = new FormData(document.getElementById("login-form"))
...
let response = await fetch("/login", {
  method: "POST",
  headers:{"Content-Type":"application/x-www-form-urlencoded"},
  body: data,
})
```

Then the actual request body sent by browser will be:

```
"username"

david
------WebKitFormBoundaryGx7UioRfdfhdT5U5
Content-Disposition: form-data; name="password"

778899sS
------WebKitFormBoundaryGx7UioRfdfhdT5U5--
```

This is not correct and you will get error at the server, the suggestion to get a correct request body is to not set header explictly:

```js
let response = await fetch("/login", {
  method: "POST",
  //headers:{"Content-Type":"application/x-www-form-urlencoded"},
  body: data,
})
```

Then the correct form data will be sent:

``` 
username: david
password: 778899s
```

> **Note:** if you don't set `Content-Type` header explicitly, the browser will set Content-Type header to `multipart/form-data` automatically. 

### 4.1. Special situation in Go

If your server written in Go, you may parse the form like this:

```go
if e := r.ParseForm(); err != nil {
  err = fmt.Errorf("failed to parse username and password: %v", e)
  return
}
username = r.Form.Get("username")
password = r.Form.Get("password")
```

According to [Golang docs](https://pkg.go.dev/net/http#Request.ParseForm) for `ParseForm() `: 

> For other HTTP methods, or when the Content-Type **is not** application/x-www-form-urlencoded, the request Body is not read. 

Therefore, `ParseForm()` method will ignore the request body, which means you cannot get the username and password. The `URLSearchParams()` in JS can help:

```js
const data = new URLSearchParams()
for (const pair of new FormData(document.getElementById("login-form"))) {
  data.append(pair[0], String(pair[1]))
}
let response = await fetch("/login", {
  method: "POST",
  //headers:{"Content-Type":"application/x-www-form-urlencoded"},
  body: data,
})
```

I find this solution on [an answer at Stackoverflow](https://stackoverflow.com/a/46642899/16317008), the problem caused by `new FormData()`:

> The **`FormData`** interface provides a way to easily construct a set of key/value pairs representing form fields and their values, which can then be easily sent using the `XMLHttpRequest.send()` method. **It uses the same format a form would use if the encoding type were set to `"multipart/form-data"`**.

So when using `FormData` you are locking yourself into `multipart/form-data`. There is no way to send a `FormData` object as the body and *not* sending data in the `multipart/form-data` format.

If you want to send the data as `application/x-www-form-urlencoded` you will either have to specify the body as an URL-encoded string, or pass a [`URLSearchParams`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/URLSearchParams) object.
