## 1. Virtual Memory

- What is virtual memory? Indirection between the program's addresses and the RAM addresses. Mapping disk space into memory. 
- Virtual memory addresses (VA) and Physical memory addresses (PA). VA is the address that the program uses. PA is the address in RAM. The MMU translates VA to PA. 

> A memory management unit (MMU) is **a computer hardware unit** that examines all memory references on the memory bus, translating these requests, known as virtual memory addresses, into physical addresses in main memory. [Memory management unit](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Memory_management_unit)

### 1.1. Example

```risc
ld r1, 400(r2)
```

This instruction means to load data into register r1 from the address calculated by adding an **offset of 400** to the content of register r2.

1. Calculate the Virtual Address:
   - Assume the register r2 currently holds the virtual address 0x1000 (4096 in decimal).
   - The offset 400 (in decimal) is added to the content of r2.
   - Therefore, the calculated virtual address is 0x1000 + 0x190 = 0x1190 (virtual address).
2. Virtual to Physical Address Translation:
   - The MMU receives the virtual address 0x1190 and begins to look up the page table **for the current process**.
   - Suppose the page table entry shows that this virtual address maps to the physical address 0x5000.
   - The page offset (offset within the page) remains 0x190.
   - Thus, the complete physical address is 0x5000 + 0x190 = 0x5190.
3. Access Physical Memory and Execute Instruction:
   - Once the physical address is determined, the MMU instructs the system to load data from physical address 0x5190.
   - The data is loaded into register r1.

### 1.2. Other Concepts

- Both MIPS and ARM are types of RISC architectures. RISC is a type of microprocessor design.
- MIPS gives each program its own 32-bit address space. Programs can only access any byte in their own address space.

2) Holes in our address space? 
3) Keeping programs secure with virtual memory.

## Segment Fault

A segmentation fault is a specific type of error that occurs when a program tries to access a segment of memory that it doesn’t have the permissions to access or that doesn’t exist, leading to the program’s abrupt termination by the operating system.
