```bash
npx create-react-app my-app

npm install some-package
```

***npx*** is a npm package runner (x probably stands for execute). One common way to use *npx* is to download and run a package temporarily.

***create-react-app*** is an npm package that is expected to be run only once in a project's lifecycle. Hence, it is preferred to use npx to install and run it in a single step.

NPM is a package manager, you can install node.js packages using NPM.

NPX is a tool to execute node.js packages.
