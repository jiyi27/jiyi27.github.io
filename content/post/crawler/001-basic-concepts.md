## 1. Web crawler

A Web crawler, sometimes called a spider or spiderbot and often shortened to crawler, is an Internet bot that systematically browses the World Wide Web and that is typically operated by search engines for the purpose of Web indexing (web spidering).

## 2. Headless browser

A headless browser is a web browser that operates without a graphical user interface (GUI). It runs in the background and interacts with web pages programmatically, just like a regular browser, but without displaying the web page to the user. Headless browsers are commonly used in web crawling and scraping applications.

## 3. Playwright library

Playwright is an open-source automation library for browser testing and web scraping developed by Microsoft and launched on 31 January 2020, which has since become popular among programmers and web developers. Playwright provides the ability to automate browser tasks in Chromium, Firefox and WebKit with a single API.
