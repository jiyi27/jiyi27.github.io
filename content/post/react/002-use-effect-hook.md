## 1. When `useEffect` is called

**What does useEffect do?** By using this Hook, you tell React that your component needs to do something **after render**. React will remember the function `setup` you passed, and call it later after performing the DOM updates.

```jsx
useEffect(setup, dependencies?)
```

- **No Dependency (No Array)**: If you donâ€™t provide the second argument, the effect runs after every rendering.
- **Empty Array (`[]`)**: If you pass an empty array, the effect runs **once after the initial rendering**. This is similar to `componentDidMount` in class components.
- **With Dependencies**: If you include values in the array, the effect will rerun when any of those values change. This is used for effects that should react to specific state changes or prop updates.

```jsx
function MyComponent() {
    const [count, setCount] = useState(0);

    console.log("1. Component function is running (render phase)");

    useEffect(() => {
        setTimeout(() => {
            console.log("3. useEffect is called (after DOM updates)");
        }, 2000);
    });

    return (
        <div>
            <p>You clicked {count} times</p>
            <button onClick={() => setCount(count + 1)}>
                Click me
            </button>
        </div>
    );
}
```

When you reload the page, you will see the following in the console (Don't use `StrictMode`):

```bash
1. Component function is running (render phase)
3. useEffect is called (after DOM updates) # 2 seconds later will print
```

When you click the button, you will see the following in the console:

```bash
1. Component function is running (render phase)
You clicked 1 times
3. useEffect is called (after DOM updates) # 2 seconds later will print
```

Here's a simplified sequence of what happens:

1. Component Function Executes: The function component runs. During this execution, it can render JSX and call hooks like useState. (Reload page, in example above)

2. Render to DOM: React updates the DOM and the screen based on the returned JSX from the function. ('You click x times', in example above)

3. After Render: Once the rendering is complete and the DOM has been updated, useEffect is called. This is done **asynchronously**; it doesn't block the browser from updating the screen. (2 seconds later, in example above)


## 2. Fetching data with Effects

```jsx
import { useState, useEffect } from 'react';
import { fetchBio } from './api.js';

export default function Page() {
  const [person, setPerson] = useState('Alice');
  const [bio, setBio] = useState(null);
  useEffect(() => {
    fetchBio(person).then(result => {
        setBio(result);
    });
  }, [person]);

  return (
    <>
      <select value={person} onChange={e => {
        setPerson(e.target.value);
      }}>
        <option value="Alice">Alice</option>
        <option value="Bob">Bob</option>
        <option value="Taylor">Taylor</option>
      </select>
      <hr />
      <p><i>{bio ?? 'Loading...'}</i></p>
    </>
  );
}
```

There is a trick, `<p><i>{bio ?? 'Loading...'}</i></p>`, 'Loading...' will be used if `bio` is null or undefined. We write it in this way because useEffect is called after the initial rendering, so `bio` will be null or undefined at the first render.

## 3. Race conditions in useEffect

> You would typically notice a race condition (in React) when two slightly different requests for data have been made, and the application displays a different result **depending on which request completes first.** 

With `cleanup` function, we can "cancel" the previous request (because `active` is false, `setData(newData);` in the previous  `useEffect` won't be called), and only use the result of the latest request. 

```js
useEffect(() => {
  let active = true;

  const fetchData = async () => {
    setTimeout(async () => {
      const response = await fetch(`https://swapi.dev/api/people/${props.id}/`);
      const newData = await response.json();
      if (active) {
        setFetchedId(props.id);
        setData(newData);
      }
    }, Math.round(Math.random() * 12000));
  };

  fetchData();
  return () => {
    active = false;
  };
}, [props.id]);
```

1. Your `setup` code runs when your component is added to the page (mounts), this is useEffect gets called after the render phase. 
2. After every re-render of your component where the dependencies have changed:
   - First, your `cleanup` code runs with the old props and state.
   - Then, your `setup` code runs with the new props and state.
3. Your `cleanup` code runs one final time after your component is removed from the page (unmounts).

So, in the above example, the `cleanup` function of the previous `useEffect` call is called before the `setup` function of the current `useEffect` is called.
